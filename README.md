# trainee-doubles_stubs_mocks
A task to explain basic ideas behind doubles, stubs and mocks in Rspec (and testing as a whole)

Here we have three objects: 

**Human** - he/she can have a pet and job. Human obviously knows and can tell you what the name of his/her pet is, and how much he/she gets paid.

**Pet** - just has a name, that's all it takes.

**Job** - has a salary.
